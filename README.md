What is it?

Did you ever get to do something and forget about it because of watching video or programming?

timedAlerts solve this problem.

You just run install script, add a timed alert and then start alert checking loop that checks if it should make an alert.

How to use?

**Note: python3 is required to run**

At first, run install_linux.sh to install on Linux.

Installers for Windows and MacOS will be avaible soon.

This will add talerts command.

Then, "talerts set --time=day:month:year-hour:minute:second" to your terminal to set alert to specified time.

If you want to start alert checking loop, write "talerts loop" to your terminal.

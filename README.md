# timedAlerts

How to use?
---

**Note: python3 is required to run**

At first, run install_linux.sh to install on Linux.

Installing for Windows and MacOS will be supported soon.

This will add set_timed_alert to bin and also setup loop that checks if alert should be made or not (starts on login).

Then, write set_timed_alert to your terminal to get help message.
